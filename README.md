# SGBP_SSL

This work  is the pytorch implementation of Efficient Training Strategy for Spiking Neural Network via Gradient Nulling Mitigation.

The implementation of the code is mostly referenced https://github.com/stonezwr/TSSL-BP . We have mainly rewritten the backpropagation process in BP/sgbp_ssl.py

## Dependencies and Libraries
 python 3.8
 pytorch
 torchvision
